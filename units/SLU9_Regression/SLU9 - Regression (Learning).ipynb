    "A modeling task which objective is to create a (linear or non-linear) map between the **independent variables** (i.e. the columns in your pandas dataframe) and a set of **continuous dependent variables** (i.e. the variable you want to predict) by estimating a set of **parameters**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of regression tasks:\n",
    "* predicting house prices (example range: [100k\\$; 500k\\$]);\n",
    "* predicting the rating that a user would assign to a movie (example range: [1 start; 7 stars]); \n",
    "* predicting the total sales for each day, in each shop of a shopping mall;\n",
    "* predicting emotional descriptors for a song;\n",
    "* predicting the trajectory of a fighter jet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's align the first 3 terms we used with an example: when predicting house prices, \n",
    "* the **independent variables** are the features related to the house like the number of rooms, the total area available, the crime rate of the area, the number of miles to the closest big city; \n",
    "* the **dependent variable** will be the price of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict the house prices, the regression model will take the independent variables and a set of internal parameters, perform a sequence of operations with those two and output the price of the house.\n",

    "Nowadays, there are *a lot* of algorithms to solve this task but we will focus on one of the most easy to understand: **linear regression**. It is one of the most used regression methods in the world to this day due to how easy it is to (1) interpret the model, (2) implement it and (3) implement extensions that deal with datasets with few data points, noise and outliers. \n",

When you use collinear features, the magnitude of the weights get's lowered for all features that are in that collinear relationship.

There are optimization algorithms that can avoid this issue but still suffer with issue (2).\n",

If a feature ($f_1$) has a domain of [-0.1; 0.1] and another ($f_2$) has domain of [0; 1000], it doesn't make sense to look at the influence in the prediction through the same lens as the ones we use in the introduction to simple linear regression (i.e. an increase of 1 unit in $x$ increases $\\beta_1$ units in $\\hat{y}$).

    "* Fast optimization\n",
    "* Easy to extend the model: you haven't seen how this is true but there is a thing called _Generalized Linear Model (GLM)_. Once you get a good grip with linear regression, you should visit the [scikit learn page on GLMs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html).\n",

    "* Sensible to outliers, eventhough there are extensions that are able to deal (partially) with this issue.\n",
    "* Assumes that there is no multicollinearity.\n",
    "* Feature scaling is required.\n",
    "* Monotonicity assumption: for the model, the relation between each feature and the output. \n",

    "At this point, if you already knew linear regression in detail before the academy, you might be wondering: *\"Where is the error component in the linear regression formula?\"*.
